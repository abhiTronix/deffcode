# :material-fast-forward-60: Saving Key-frames as Image


!!! abstract "When working with video files, you might want to extract a specific part, like an image frame from a particular time in the video. This process is called _Seeking_."

> DeFFcode's FFdecoder API provide effortless and precise **Frame Seeking** with `-ss` FFmpeg parameter that enable us to save any frame from a specific part of our input source in a couple of ways.  

We'll discuss about it briefly in the following recipes:

!!! warning "DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg executable"

    ==DeFFcode APIs **MUST** requires valid FFmpeg executable for all of its core functionality==, and any failure in detection will raise `RuntimeError` immediately. Follow dedicated [FFmpeg Installation doc âž¶](../../../installation/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

??? info "Additional Python Dependencies for following recipes"

    Following recipes requires additional python dependencies which can be installed easily as below:

    - [x] **OpenCV:** OpenCV is required for saving video frames. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ??? tip "OpenCV installation from source"

            You can also follow online tutorials for building & installing OpenCV on [Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/), [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [MacOS](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) machines manually from its source. 

            :warning: Make sure not to install both *pip* and *source* version together. Otherwise installation will fail to work!

        ??? info "Other OpenCV binaries"

            OpenCV maintainers also provide additional binaries via pip that contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules [`opencv-contrib-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/), and for server (headless) environments like [`opencv-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) and [`opencv-contrib-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python-headless/). You can also install ==any one of them== in similar manner. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python#installation-and-usage).


        ```sh
        pip install opencv-python       
        ```

    - [x] **Pillow:** Pillow is a Imaging Library required for saving frame as Image. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ```sh
        pip install Pillow     
        ```

    - [x] **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, also required for saving frame as Image. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ```sh
        pip install matplotlib   
        ```

    - [x] **Imageio:** Imageio is a Library for reading and writing a wide range of image, video, scientific, and volumetric data formats, also required for saving frame as Image. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ```sh
        pip install imageio      
        ```


!!! note "Always use FFdecoder API's [`terminate()`](../../reference/ffdecoder/#deffcode.ffdecoder.FFdecoder.terminate) method at the end to avoid undesired behavior."

??? danger "Never name your python script `deffcode.py`"

    When trying out these recipes, never name your python script `deffcode.py` otherwise it will result in `ModuleNotFound` error.

&thinsp;

## Extracting Key-frames as PNG image

In this example, we will utilize both Input and Output Seeking to seek to `00:00:01.45` _(or 1045 ms)_ and decode a single frame using the FFdecoder API. We will then save it as a PNG image using prominent image processing Python libraries, providing a valid filename _(e.g., `foo_image.png`)_.

??? tip "Time unit syntax in `-ss` FFmpeg parameter"
    
    You can use two different time unit formats with `-ss` FFmpeg parameter: 

    - [x] **Sexagesimal(in seconds):** Uses *(HOURS:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS)* format, such as in `01:23:45.678`.
    - [x] **Fractional:** such as in `02:30.05`. This is interpreted as _2 minutes, 30 and a half a second_, which would be the same as using `150.5` in seconds.

### A. Input Seeking (Recommended)

This is when you tell FFmpeg to jump to a specific time in the video before it starts reading it.

??? question "When to use Input Seeking?"

    Best for speed and accuracy with minimal CPU usage, but may reset timestamps:

    - [x] **Pros:**
        - **Fast:** Fast seeking as it jumps directly to the specified keyframe.
        - **Low CPU Usage:** Reduced processing power since it doesn't decode frames until the specified time.
    - [ ] **Cons:**
        - **No Filter Preservation:** Timestamp-sensitive filters (like subtitles) might not work as expected since timestamps are reset.

!!! note "The recommend way to use Input Seeking is to use `-ss` parameter via. exclusive [`-ffprefixes`](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#b-exclusive-parameters) list attribute of `ffparam` dictionary parameter in FFdecoder API."
    
=== "Using Pillow"

    In Pillow, the `fromarray()` function can be used to create an image memory from an **RGB** frame:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    from PIL import Image

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to jump to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec)
    # in time in the video before it starts reading it and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ffprefixes": ["-ss", "00:00:01.45"], "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not (frame is None):
        # Convert to Image
        im = Image.fromarray(frame)
        # Save Image as PNG
        im.save("foo_image.png")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Using OpenCV"

    In OpenCV, the `imwrite()` function can export **BGR** frame as an image file:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to jump to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec)
    # in time in the video before it starts reading it and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ffprefixes": ["-ss", "00:00:01.45"], "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder for BGR24 outputwith suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", frame_format="bgr24", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the BGR24 frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our image as PNG
        cv2.imwrite('foo_image.png', frame)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Using Matplotlib"

    In Matplotlib, the `imsave()` function can save an **RGB** frame as an image file:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to jump to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec)
    # in time in the video before it starts reading it and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ffprefixes": ["-ss", "00:00:01.45"], "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our image as PNG
        plt.imsave('foo_image.png', frame)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Using Imageio"

    In Imageio, the `imwrite()` function can be used to create an image memory from an **RGB** frame:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import imageio

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to jump to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec)
    # in time in the video before it starts reading it and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ffprefixes": ["-ss", "00:00:01.45"], "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our output
        imageio.imwrite('foo_image.jpeg', frame)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

### B. Output Seeking

This is when you tell FFmpeg to start seeking the video after it has read it.

??? question "When to use Output Seeking?"

    Best for accurate filtering and timestamp preservation, but slower and CPU-intensive.

    - [x] **Pros:**
        - **Timestamp Integrity:** Maintains original timestamps, which is crucial for filters and processing (e.g., subtitle syncing).
        - **Precise Frame Retrieval:** Decodes every frame, ensuring exact frame extraction.
        - **Filter Compatibility:** Works well with various filters that require accurate timestamps.
    - [ ] **Cons:**
        - **Slower Processing:** Decodes and discards frames until it reaches the specified time, which can be time-consuming.
        - **Higher CPU Usage:** Increased processing power required due to frame-by-frame decoding.
        - **Long Latency for Large Offsets:** Longer waiting times for videos with large offsets.
    
=== "Using Pillow"

    In Pillow, the `fromarray()` function can be used to create an image memory from an **RGB** frame:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    from PIL import Image

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to first read the frames and afterward
    # jump to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec) and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ss": "00:00:01.45", "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not (frame is None):
        # Convert to Image
        im = Image.fromarray(frame)
        # Save Image as PNG
        im.save("foo_image.png")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

    # jump to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec) and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ss": "00:00:01.45", "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder for BGR24 outputwith suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", frame_format="bgr24", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the BGR24 frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our image as PNG
        cv2.imwrite('foo_image.png', frame)
    else:

    ffparams = {"-ss": "00:00:01.45", "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our output

<figcaption><code>fancy_thumbnail.jpg</code> (Courtesy - <a href="https://peach.blender.org/trailer-page/">BigBuckBunny</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

In this example we first apply FFmpegâ€™s `tblend` filter  with an `hardmix` blend mode _(cool stuff)_, and after reading those frames seek to `00:00:25.917`_(or 25.917sec)_ in time to retrieve our single frame thumbnail, and finally save it as JPEG image with valid filename _(e.g. `fancy_thumbnail.jpg`)_ using Pillow library.

!!! alert "Use Output Seeking with filters for accurate results, as Input Seeking can reset timestamps and lead to inaccuracies."

??? tip "Time unit syntax in `-ss` FFmpeg parameter"
    
    You can use two different time unit formats with `-ss` FFmpeg parameter: 

    - [x] **Sexagesimal(in seconds):** Uses *(HOURS:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS)*, such as in `01:23:45.678`
    - [x] **Fractional:** such as in `02:30.05`, this is interpreted as 2 minutes, 30 seconds, and a half a second, which would be the same as using 150.5 in seconds.

??? info "Available blend mode options" 

    **Other blend mode options for `tblend` filter include:** `addition`, `addition128`, `grainmerge`, `and`, `average`, `burn`, `darken`, `difference`, `difference128`, `grainextract`, `divide`, `dodge`, `freeze`, `exclusion`, `extremity`, `glow`, `hardlight`, `hardmix`, `heat`, `lighten`, `linearlight`, `multiply`, `multiply128`, `negation`, `normal`, `or`, `overlay`, `phoenix`, `pinlight`, `reflect`, `screen`, `softlight`, `subtract`, `vividlight`, `xor`

```python
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder
from PIL import Image

# define the FFmpeg parameter to
ffparams = {
    "-vf": "tblend=all_mode='hardmix'",  # trim and reverse
    "-ss": "00:00:25.917",  # seek to 00:00:25.917(or 25s 917msec)
    "-frames:v": 1,  # get one single frame
}

# initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
decoder = FFdecoder("BigBuckBunny.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

# grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

# check if frame is None
if not (frame is None):
    # Convert to Image
    im = Image.fromarray(frame)
    # Save Image as JPEG
    im.save("fancy_thumbnail.jpg")
else:
    raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
