# :material-fast-forward-60: Saving Key-frames as Image


> DeFFcode's FFdecoder API provide effortless and precise **Frame Seeking** with `-ss` FFmpeg parameter that enable us to save any frame from a specific part of our input source.  

We'll discuss aboout it briefly in the following recipes:

&thinsp;

!!! warning "DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg executable"

    ==DeFFcode APIs **MUST** requires valid FFmpeg executable for all of its core functionality==, and any failure in detection will raise `RuntimeError` immediately. Follow dedicated [FFmpeg Installation doc ➶](../../../installation/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

???+ info "Additional Python Dependencies for following recipes"

    Following recipes requires additional python dependencies which can be installed easily as below:

    - [x] **OpenCV:** OpenCV is required for saving video frames. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ??? tip "OpenCV installation from source"

            You can also follow online tutorials for building & installing OpenCV on [Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/), [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [MacOS](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) machines manually from its source. 

            :warning: Make sure not to install both *pip* and *source* version together. Otherwise installation will fail to work!

        ??? info "Other OpenCV binaries"

            OpenCV mainainers also provide additional binaries via pip that contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules [`opencv-contrib-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/), and for server (headless) environments like [`opencv-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) and [`opencv-contrib-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python-headless/). You can also install ==any one of them== in similar manner. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python#installation-and-usage).


        ```sh
        pip install opencv-python       
        ```

    - [x] **Pillow:** Pillow is a Imaging Library required for saving frame as Image. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ```sh
        pip install Pillow     
        ```

    - [x] **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, also required for saving frame as Image. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ```sh
        pip install matplotlib   
        ```

    - [x] **Imageio:** Imageio is a Library for reading and writing a wide range of image, video, scientific, and volumetric data formats, also required for saving frame as Image. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ```sh
        pip install imageio      
        ```


!!! note "Always use FFdecoder API's [`terminate()`](../../reference/ffdecoder/#deffcode.ffdecoder.FFdecoder.terminate) method at the end to avoid undesired behavior."

??? danger "Never name your python script `deffcode.py`"

    When trying out these recipes, never name your python script `deffcode.py` otherwise it will result in `ModuleNotFound` error.

&thinsp;

## Extracting Key-frames as PNG image

In this example we will seek to `00:00:01.45`_(or 1045msec)_ in time and decode one single frame in FFdecoder API, and thereby saving it as PNG image using few prominent Image processing python libraries by providing valid filename _(e.g. `foo_image.png`)_.

??? tip "Time unit syntax in `-ss` FFmpeg parameter"
    
    You can use two different time unit formats with `-ss` FFmpeg parameter: 

    - [x] **Sexagesimal(in seconds):** Uses *(HOURS:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS)* format, such as in `01:23:45.678`.
    - [x] **Fractional:** such as in `02:30.05`. This is interpreted as _2 minutes, 30 and a half a second_, which would be the same as using `150.5` in seconds.

=== "Using Pillow"

    In Pillow, the `fromarray()` function can be used to create an image memory from an **RGB** frame:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    from PIL import Image

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to seek to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec)
    # in time and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ss": "00:00:01.45", "-frames:v": 1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not (frame is None):
        # Convert to Image
        im = Image.fromarray(frame)
        # Save Image as PNG
        im.save("foo_image.png")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Using OpenCV"

    In OpenCV, the `imwrite()` function can export **BGR** frame as an image file:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to seek to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec) 
    # in time and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ss": "00:00:01.45", "-frames:v":1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder for BGR24 outputwith suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", frame_format="bgr24", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the BGR24 frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our image as PNG
        cv2.imwrite('foo_image.png', frame)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Using Matplotlib"

    In Matplotlib, the `imsave()` function can save an **RGB** frame as an image file:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to seek to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec) 
    # in time and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ss": "00:00:01.45", "-frames:v":1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our image as PNG
        plt.imsave('foo_image.png', frame)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Using Imageio"

    In Imageio, the `imwrite()` function can be used to create an image memory from an **RGB** frame:

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import imageio

    # define the FFmpeg parameter to seek to 00:00:01.45(or 1s and 45msec) 
    # in time and get one single frame
    ffparams = {"-ss": "00:00:01.45", "-frames:v":1}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
    frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

    # check if frame is None
    if not(frame is None):
        # Save our output
        imageio.imwrite('foo_image.jpeg', frame)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

<figcaption><code>fancy_thumbnail.jpg</code> (Courtesy - <a href="https://peach.blender.org/trailer-page/">BigBuckBunny</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

In this example we first apply FFmpeg’s `tblend` filter  with an `hardmix` blend mode _(cool stuff)_ and then seek to `00:00:25.917`_(or 25.917sec)_ in time to retrieve our single frame thumbnail, and thereby save it as JPEG image with valid filename _(e.g. `fancy_thumbnail.jpg`)_ using Pillow library.

??? tip "Time unit syntax in `-ss` FFmpeg parameter"
    
    You can use two different time unit formats with `-ss` FFmpeg parameter: 
    - [x] **Sexagesimal(in seconds):** Uses *(HOURS:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS)*, such as in `01:23:45.678`
    - [x] **Fractional:** such as in `02:30.05`, this is interpreted as 2 minutes, 30 seconds, and a half a second, which would be the same as using 150.5 in seconds.

??? info "Available blend mode options" 

    **Other blend mode options for `tblend` filter include:** `addition`, `addition128`, `grainmerge`, `and`, `average`, `burn`, `darken`, `difference`, `difference128`, `grainextract`, `divide`, `dodge`, `freeze`, `exclusion`, `extremity`, `glow`, `hardlight`, `hardmix`, `heat`, `lighten`, `linearlight`, `multiply`, `multiply128`, `negation`, `normal`, `or`, `overlay`, `phoenix`, `pinlight`, `reflect`, `screen`, `softlight`, `subtract`, `vividlight`, `xor`

```python
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder
from PIL import Image

# define the FFmpeg parameter to
ffparams = {
    "-vf": "tblend=all_mode='hardmix'",  # trim and reverse
    "-ss": "00:00:25.917",  # seek to 00:00:25.917(or 25s 917msec)
    "-frames:v": 1,  # get one single frame
}

# initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
decoder = FFdecoder("BigBuckBunny.mp4", **ffparams).formulate()

# grab the RGB24(default) frame from the decoder
frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

# check if frame is None
if not (frame is None):
    # Convert to Image
    im = Image.fromarray(frame)
    # Save Image as JPEG
    im.save("fancy_thumbnail.jpg")
else:
    raise ValueError("Something is wrong!")

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()

```
