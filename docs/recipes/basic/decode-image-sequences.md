# :material-image-multiple: Decoding Image sequences

> DeFFcode's FFdecoder API supports a wide-ranging media streams as input to its [`source`](../../reference/sourcer/params/#source) parameter, which also includes **Image Sequences** such as Sequential(`img%03d.png`) and Glob pattern(`*.png`) as well as **Single looping image**. 

We'll discuss both briefly in the following recipes:

&thinsp;

!!! warning "DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg executable"

    ==DeFFcode APIs **MUST** requires valid FFmpeg executable for all of its core functionality==, and any failure in detection will raise `RuntimeError` immediately. Follow dedicated [FFmpeg Installation doc ➶](../../../installation/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

???+ info "Additional Python Dependencies for following recipes"

    Following recipes requires additional python dependencies which can be installed easily as below:

    - [x] **OpenCV:** OpenCV is required for previewing video frames. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ??? tip "OpenCV installation from source"

            You can also follow online tutorials for building & installing OpenCV on [Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/), [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [MacOS](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) machines manually from its source. 

            :warning: Make sure not to install both *pip* and *source* version together. Otherwise installation will fail to work!

        ??? info "Other OpenCV binaries"

            OpenCV mainainers also provide additional binaries via pip that contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules [`opencv-contrib-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/), and for server (headless) environments like [`opencv-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) and [`opencv-contrib-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python-headless/). You can also install ==any one of them== in similar manner. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python#installation-and-usage).


        ```sh
        pip install opencv-python       
        ```


!!! note "Always use FFdecoder API's [`terminate()`](../../reference/ffdecoder/#deffcode.ffdecoder.FFdecoder.terminate) method at the end to avoid undesired behavior."

??? danger "Never name your python script `deffcode.py`"

    When trying out these recipes, never name your python script `deffcode.py` otherwise it will result in `ModuleNotFound` error.

&thinsp;

## Capturing and Previewing frames from Sequence of images

In this example we will capture video frames from a given Image Sequence using FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method in real-time.

!!! alert "OpenCV expects `BGR` format frames in its `cv2.imshow()` method."


??? tip "Extracting Image Sequences from a video"
    
    **You can use following FFmpeg command to extract sequences of images from a video file `foo.mp4`:**
    
    ```sh
    $ ffmpeg -i foo.mp4 /path/to/image-%03d.png
    ```

    The default framerate is `25` fps, therefore this command will extract `25 images/sec` from the video file, and save them as sequences of images _(starting from `image-000.png`, `image-001.png`, `image-002.png` up to `image-999.png`)_. 

    !!! info "If there are more than `1000` frames then the last image will be overwritten with the remaining frames leaving only the last frame."

    The default images width and height is same as the video.

=== "Sequential"

    ??? question "How to start with specific number image?"
        You can use `-start_number` FFmpeg parameter if you want to start with specific number image:

        ```python
        # define `-start_number` such as `5`
        ffparams = {"-ffprefixes":["-start_number", "5"]}

        # initialize and formulate the decoder with define parameters
        decoder = FFdecoder('img%03d.png', verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()
        ```

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("/path/to/pngs/img%03d.png", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True).formulate()

    # grab the BGR24 frame from the decoder
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Glob pattern"

    !!! abstract "Bash-style globbing _(`*` represents any number of any characters)_ is useful if your images are sequential but not necessarily in a numerically sequential order."

    !!! warning "The glob pattern is not available on Windows FFmpeg builds."

    !!! note "To learn more about exclusive `-ffprefixes` parameter. See [Exclusive Parameters ➶](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#b-exclusive-parameters)"

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # define `-pattern_type glob` for accepting glob pattern
    ffparams = {"-ffprefixes":["-pattern_type", "glob"]}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("/path/to/pngs/img*.png", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()


    # grab the GRAYSCALE frame from the decoder
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break


    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

## Capturing and Previewing frames from Single looping image

In this example we will capture video frames from a Single Looping image using FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method in real-time.

!!! alert "By default, OpenCV expects `BGR` format frames in its `cv2.imshow()` method."

!!! note "To learn more about exclusive `-ffprefixes` parameter. See [Exclusive Parameters ➶](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#b-exclusive-parameters)"

```python
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder
import cv2

# define `-loop 1` for infinite looping
ffparams = {"-ffprefixes":["-loop", "1"]}

# initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
decoder = FFdecoder("img.png", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()

# grab the BGR24 frame from the decoder
for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

    # check if frame is None
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the frame here}

    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
```
