# :material-file-eye: Decoding Video files

> DeFFcode's FFdecoder API readily supports multimedia Video files path as input to its [`source`](../../reference/sourcer/params/#source) parameter. And with its [`frame_format`](../../reference/sourcer/params/#frame_format) parameter, you can easily decode video frames in any pixel format(s) that are readily supported by all well known Computer Vision libraries _(such as OpenCV)_.  

We'll discuss its video files support and pixel format capabilities briefly in the following recipes:

&thinsp;

!!! warning "DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg executable"

    ==DeFFcode APIs **MUST** requires valid FFmpeg executable for all of its core functionality==, and any failure in detection will raise `RuntimeError` immediately. Follow dedicated [FFmpeg Installation doc âž¶](../../../installation/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

??? info "Additional Python Dependencies for following recipes"

    Following recipes requires additional python dependencies which can be installed easily as below:

    - [x] **OpenCV:** OpenCV is required for previewing video frames. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ??? tip "OpenCV installation from source"

            You can also follow online tutorials for building & installing OpenCV on [Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/), [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [MacOS](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) machines manually from its source. 

            :warning: Make sure not to install both *pip* and *source* version together. Otherwise installation will fail to work!

        ??? info "Other OpenCV binaries"

            OpenCV maintainers also provide additional binaries via pip that contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules [`opencv-contrib-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/), and for server (headless) environments like [`opencv-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) and [`opencv-contrib-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python-headless/). You can also install ==any one of them== in similar manner. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python#installation-and-usage).


        ```sh
        pip install opencv-python       
        ```


!!! note "Always use FFdecoder API's [`terminate()`](../../reference/ffdecoder/#deffcode.ffdecoder.FFdecoder.terminate) method at the end to avoid undesired behavior."

??? danger "Never name your python script `deffcode.py`"

    When trying out these recipes, never name your python script `deffcode.py` otherwise it will result in `ModuleNotFound` error.

## Accessing RGB frames from a video file


!!! abstract "The default function of FFdecoder API is to **decode 24-bit RGB video frames** from the given source."

> FFdecoder API's [`generateFrame()`](../../reference/ffdecoder/#deffcode.ffdecoder.FFdecoder.generateFrame) function can be used in multiple methods to access RGB frames from a given source, such as **as a Generator** _(Recommended Approach)_, **calling `with` Statement**, and **as a Iterator**. 

In this example we will decode the default **RGB24** video frames from a given Video file _(say `foo.mp4`)_ using above mentioned  accessing methods:


=== "As a Generator (Recommended)"

    !!! quote "This is a recommended approach for faster and error-proof access of decoded frames. We'll use it throughout the recipes."

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder

    # initialize and formulate the decoder
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4").formulate()

    # grab RGB24(default) frame from decoder
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # lets print its shape
        print(frame.shape) # for e.g. (1080, 1920, 3)

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Calling `with` Statement"

    !!! quote "Calling `with` Statement approach can be used to make the code easier, cleaner, and much more readable. This approach also automatically handles management of `formulate()` and `terminate()` methods in FFdecoder API, so don't need to explicitly call them. See [PEP343 -- The 'with' statement'](https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/) for more information on this approach."

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # initialize and formulate the decoder
    with FFdecoder("foo.mp4") as decoder:

        # grab the BGR24 frames from decoder
        for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

            # check if frame is None
            if frame is None:
                break

            # {do something with the frame here}

            # lets print its shape
            print(frame.shape)  # for e.g. (1080, 1920, 3)
    ```

=== "As a Iterator"

    !!! quote "This Iterator Approach bears a close resemblance to **OpenCV-Python** _(Python API for OpenCV)_ coding syntax, thereby easier to learn and remember."

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder

    # initialize and formulate the decoder
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4").formulate()

    # loop over frames
    while True:

        # grab RGB24(default) frames from decoder
        frame = next(decoder.generateFrame(), None)

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}
        
        # lets print its shape
        print(frame.shape) # for e.g. (1080, 1920, 3)

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

## Capturing and Previewing BGR frames from a video file

In this example we will decode **OpenCV supported** live **BGR24** video frames from a given Video file _(say `foo.mp4`)_ in FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method.

!!! alert "By default, OpenCV expects `BGR` format frames in its `cv2.imshow()` method by using two accessing methods."

=== "As a Generator (Recommended)"

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # initialize and formulate the decoder for BGR24 pixel format output
    decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4", frame_format="bgr24").formulate()

    # grab the BGR24 frames from decoder
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}
        
        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Calling `with` Statement"

    !!! quote "Calling `with` Statement approach can be used to make the code easier, cleaner, and much more readable. This approach also automatically handles management of `formulate()` and `terminate()` methods in FFdecoder API, so don't need to explicitly call them. See [PEP343 -- The 'with' statement'](https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/) for more information on this approach."

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # initialize and formulate the decoder for BGR24 pixel format output
    with FFdecoder("foo.mp4", frame_format="bgr24") as decoder:

        # grab the BGR24 frames from decoder
        for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

            # check if frame is None
            if frame is None:
                break

            # {do something with the frame here}

            # Show output window
            cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

            # check for 'q' key if pressed
            key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
            if key == ord("q"):
                break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    ```

&nbsp;

## Playing with any other FFmpeg pixel formats

!!! abstract "Similar to BGR, you can input any pixel format _(supported by installed FFmpeg)_ by way of `frame_format` parameter of FFdecoder API for the desired video frame format."

In this example we will decode live **Grayscale** and **YUV** video frames from a given Video file _(say `foo.mp4`)_ in FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method.

!!! tip "Use `#!sh ffmpeg -pix_fmts` terminal command to lists all FFmpeg supported pixel formats."

=== "Decode Grayscale"

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # initialize and formulate the decoder for GRAYSCALE output
    decoder = FFdecoder("input_foo.mp4", frame_format="gray", verbose=True).formulate()

    # grab the GRAYSCALE frames from the decoder
    for gray in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if gray is None:
            break

        # {do something with the gray frame here}
        
        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Gray Output", gray)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Decode YUV frames"

    !!! quote "With FFdecoder API, frames extracted with YUV pixel formats _(`yuv420p`, `yuv444p`, `nv12`, `nv21` etc.)_ are generally incompatible with OpenCV APIs. But you can make them easily compatible by using exclusive [`-enforce_cv_patch`](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#b-exclusive-parameters) boolean attribute of its `ffparam` dictionary parameter."

    Let's try decoding YUV420p pixel-format frames in following python code:

    !!! info "You can also use other YUV pixel formats such `yuv422p`(4:2:2 subsampling) or `yuv444p`(4:4:4 subsampling) etc. instead for more higher dynamic range in the similar manner."

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # enable OpenCV patch for YUV frames
    ffparams = {"-enforce_cv_patch": True}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder for YUV420p output
    decoder = FFdecoder(
        "input_foo.mp4", frame_format="yuv420p", verbose=True, **ffparams
    ).formulate()

    # grab the YUV420p frames from the decoder
    for yuv in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if yuv is None:
            break

        # convert it to `BGR` pixel format,
        # since imshow() method only accepts `BGR` frames
        bgr = cv2.cvtColor(yuv, cv2.COLOR_YUV2BGR_I420)

        # {do something with the bgr frame here}

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output", bgr)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

## Capturing and Previewing frames from a Looping Video

In this example we will decode live **BGR24** video frames from looping video using different means in FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method.

=== "Using `-stream_loop` option"

    The recommend way to loop video is to use `-stream_loop` option via. [`-ffprefixes`](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#b-exclusive-parameters) list attribute of `ffparam` dictionary parameter in FFdecoder API. **Possible values are integer values:** `> 0` value of loop, `0` means no loop, `-1` means infinite loop.

    !!! note "Using `-stream_loop 3` will loop video `4` times."

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # define `-stream_loop 3` for looping 4 times
    ffparams = {"-ffprefixes":["-stream_loop", "3"]}

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder("input.mp4", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()

    # print metadata as `json.dump`
    print(decoder.metadata)

    # grab the BGR24 frame from the decoder
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```

=== "Using `loop` filter"

    Another way to loop video is to use `loop` complex filter via. `-filter_complex` FFmpeg flag as attribute of `ffparam` dictionary parameter in FFdecoder API. 

    !!! warning "This filter places all frames into memory(RAM), so applying [`trim`](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#toc-trim) filter first is strongly recommended. Otherwise you might probably run Out of Memory."

    !!! tip "Using `loop` filter for looping video"
        The filter accepts the following options:
        
        - `loop`: Sets the number of loops for integer values `>0`. Setting this value to `-1` will result in infinite loops. Default is `0`(no loops).
        - `size`: Sets maximal size in number of frames. Default is `0`.
        - `start`: Sets first frame of loop. Default is `0`.

    !!! note "Using `loop=3` will loop video `4` times."

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # define loop 4 times, each loop is 15 frames, each loop skips the first 25 frames
    ffparams = {
        "-filter_complex": "loop=loop=3:size=15:start=25" # Or use: `loop=3:15:25`
    }  

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with suitable source
    decoder = FFdecoder(
        "input.mp4", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams
    ).formulate()

    # print metadata as `json.dump`
    print(decoder.metadata)

    # grab the BGR24 frame from the decoder
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```
