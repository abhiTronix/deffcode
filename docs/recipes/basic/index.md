!!! alert "Refer Installation doc first!"

    If this is your first time using DeFFcode, head straight to the **[Installation Notes](../../installation/#installation-notes) to install DeFFcode with required prerequisites on your machine**.


??? tip "Any proficiency with OpenCV-Python will be Helpful"
    
    If you've any proficiency with [**OpenCV-Python**](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) _(Python API for OpenCV)_, you will find these recipes really easy. 

??? question "Wanna suggest any improvements or additional recipes?"

    Please feel free to suggest any improvements or additional recipes on our [**Gitter community channel âž¶**][gitter]

??? info "Frames are actually 3D Numpy arrays"
    
    In python, "**Frames**" are actually three-dimensional :material-video-3d: [NumPy `ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html) composed of 3 nested levels of arrays, one for each dimension.
