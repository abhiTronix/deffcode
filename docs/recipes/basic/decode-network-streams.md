# :fontawesome-solid-cloud-arrow-down: Decoding Network Streams

> Similar to decoding Video files, DeFFcode's FFdecoder API directly supports Network Streams with specific protocols _(such as RTSP/RTP, HTTP(s), MPEG-TS, etc.)_ as input to its [`source`](../../reference/sourcer/params/#source) parameter. 

We'll discuss Network Streams support briefly in the following recipes:

&thinsp;

!!! warning "DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg executable"

    ==DeFFcode APIs **MUST** requires valid FFmpeg executable for all of its core functionality==, and any failure in detection will raise `RuntimeError` immediately. Follow dedicated [FFmpeg Installation doc ➶](../../installation/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

???+ info "Additional Python Dependencies for following recipes"

    Following recipes requires additional python dependencies which can be installed easily as below:

    - [x] **OpenCV:** OpenCV is required for previewing video frames. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ??? tip "OpenCV installation from source"

            You can also follow online tutorials for building & installing OpenCV on [Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/), [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [MacOS](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) machines manually from its source. 

            :warning: Make sure not to install both *pip* and *source* version together. Otherwise installation will fail to work!

        ??? info "Other OpenCV binaries"

            OpenCV mainainers also provide additional binaries via pip that contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules [`opencv-contrib-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/), and for server (headless) environments like [`opencv-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) and [`opencv-contrib-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python-headless/). You can also install ==any one of them== in similar manner. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python#installation-and-usage).


        ```sh
        pip install opencv-python       
        ```


!!! note "Always use FFdecoder API's [`terminate()`](../../reference/ffdecoder/#deffcode.ffdecoder.FFdecoder.terminate) method at the end to avoid undesired behavior."

??? danger "Never name your python script `deffcode.py`"

    When trying out these recipes, never name your python script `deffcode.py` otherwise it will result in `ModuleNotFound` error.

## Capturing and Previewing frames from a HTTPs Stream

In this example we will decode live **BGR24** video frames from a HTTPs protocol Stream in FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method.


```python
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder
import cv2

# initialize and formulate the decoder for BGR24 pixel format output
decoder = FFdecoder("https://abhitronix.github.io/html/Big_Buck_Bunny_1080_10s_1MB.mp4", frame_format="bgr24").formulate()

# grab the BGR24 frames from decoder
for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

    # check if frame is None
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the frame here}
    
    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
```

## Capturing and Previewing frames from a RTSP/RTP Stream

In this example we will decode live **BGR24** video frames from RTSP/RTP protocol Streams in FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method.

!!! alert "This example assume you already have a RSTP Server running at specified RSTP address with syntax `rtsp://[RTSP_ADDRESS]:[RTSP_PORT]/[RTSP_PATH]` and video data already being published to it."

!!! tip "For creating your own RSTP Server locally and publishing video data to it, You can refer this [WriteGear API's bonus example ➶](https://abhitronix.github.io/vidgear/dev/help/writegear_ex/#using-writegears-compression-mode-for-rtsprtp-live-streaming)"

!!! danger "Make sure to change RSTP address `rtsp://localhost:8554/mystream` with yours in following code before running"

```python
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder
import cv2

# define suitable parameters
ffparams = {"-rtsp_transport": "tcp"}

# initialize and formulate the decoder with RTSP protocol source for BGR24 output
# [WARNING] Change your RSTP address `rtsp://localhost:8554/mystream` with yours!
decoder = FFdecoder("rtsp://localhost:8554/mystream", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()

# grab the BGR24 frames from decoder
for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

    # check if frame is None
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the frame here}
    
    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
```
