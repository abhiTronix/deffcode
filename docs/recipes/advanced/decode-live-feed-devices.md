# :material-camera-iris: Decoding Live Feed Devices

> DeFFcode's FFdecoder API provide effortless support for any Live Feed Devices using two parameters: [`source`](../../reference/sourcer/params/#source) parameter which accepts device name or its path, and [`source_demuxer`](../../reference/sourcer/params/#source_demuxer) parameter to specify demuxer for the given input device. 

We'll discuss the Live Feed Devices support using both these parameters briefly in the following recipes:

&thinsp;

!!! warning "DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg executable"

    ==DeFFcode APIs **MUST** requires valid FFmpeg executable for all of its core functionality==, and any failure in detection will raise `RuntimeError` immediately. Follow dedicated [FFmpeg Installation doc âž¶](../../../installation/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

???+ info "Additional Python Dependencies for following recipes"

    Following recipes requires additional python dependencies which can be installed easily as below:

    - [x] **OpenCV:** OpenCV is required for previewing video frames. You can easily install it directly via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

        ??? tip "OpenCV installation from source"

            You can also follow online tutorials for building & installing OpenCV on [Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/), [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [MacOS](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) machines manually from its source. 

            :warning: Make sure not to install both *pip* and *source* version together. Otherwise installation will fail to work!

        ??? info "Other OpenCV binaries"

            OpenCV mainainers also provide additional binaries via pip that contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules [`opencv-contrib-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/), and for server (headless) environments like [`opencv-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) and [`opencv-contrib-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python-headless/). You can also install ==any one of them== in similar manner. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python#installation-and-usage).


        ```sh
        pip install opencv-python       
        ```


!!! note "Always use FFdecoder API's [`terminate()`](../../reference/ffdecoder/#deffcode.ffdecoder.FFdecoder.terminate) method at the end to avoid undesired behavior."

??? danger "Never name your python script `deffcode.py`"

    When trying out these recipes, never name your python script `deffcode.py` otherwise it will result in `ModuleNotFound` error.

## Capturing and Previewing frames from a Webcam using Custom Demuxer

???+ alert "Example Assumptions"

    FFmpeg provide set of specific Demuxers on different platforms to read the multimedia streams from a particular type of Video Capture source/device. Please note that following recipe explicitly assumes: 

    - You're running Linux Machine with USB webcam connected to it at node/path `/dev/video0`. 
    - You already have appropriate Linux video drivers and related softwares installed on your machine.
    - You machine uses FFmpeg binaries built with `--enable-libv4l2` flag to support `video4linux2, v4l2` demuxer. BTW, you can list all supported demuxers using the `#!sh ffmpeg --list-demuxers` terminal command.

    These assumptions **MAY/MAY NOT** suit your current setup. Kindly use suitable parameters based your system platform and hardware settings only.


In this example we will decode **BGR24** video frames from a USB webcam device connected at path `/dev/video0` on a Linux Machine with `video4linux2` _(or simply `v4l2`)_ demuxer, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method.


??? tip "Identifying and Specifying Video Capture Device Name/Path/Index and suitable Demuxer on different OS platforms"

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

        Windows OS users can use the [dshow](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/DirectShow) (DirectShow) to list video input device which is the preferred option for Windows users. You can refer following steps to identify and specify your input video device's name:

        - [x] **Identify Video Devices:** You can locate your video device's name _(already connected to your system)_ using `dshow` as follows:

            ```sh
            c:\> ffmpeg.exe -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
            
            ffmpeg version N-45279-g6b86dd5... --enable-runtime-cpudetect
              libavutil      51. 74.100 / 51. 74.100
              libavcodec     54. 65.100 / 54. 65.100
              libavformat    54. 31.100 / 54. 31.100
              libavdevice    54.  3.100 / 54.  3.100
              libavfilter     3. 19.102 /  3. 19.102
              libswscale      2.  1.101 /  2.  1.101
              libswresample   0. 16.100 /  0. 16.100
            [dshow @ 03ACF580] DirectShow video devices
            [dshow @ 03ACF580]  "Integrated Camera"
            [dshow @ 03ACF580]  "USB2.0 Camera"
            [dshow @ 03ACF580] DirectShow audio devices
            [dshow @ 03ACF580]  "Microphone (Realtek High Definition Audio)"
            [dshow @ 03ACF580]  "Microphone (USB2.0 Camera)"
            dummy: Immediate exit requested
            ```


        - [x] **Specify Video Device's name:** Then, you can specify and initialize your located Video device's name in FFdecoder API as follows:

            ```python
            # initialize and formulate the decoder with "USB2.0 Camera" source for BGR24 output
            decoder = FFdecoder("USB2.0 Camera", source_demuxer="dshow", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True).formulate()
            ```

        - [x] **[OPTIONAL] Specify Video Device's index along with name:** If there are multiple Video devices with similar name, then you can use `-video_device_number` parameter to specify the arbitrary index of the particular device. For instance, to open second video device with name `"Camera"` you can do as follows:

            ```python
            # define video_device_number as 1 (numbering start from 0)
            ffparams = {"-ffprefixes":["-video_device_number", "1"]}

            # initialize and formulate the decoder with "Camera" source for BGR24 output
            decoder = FFdecoder("Camera", source_demuxer="dshow", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()
            ```

    === ":material-linux: Linux"

        Linux OS users can use the [`video4linux2`](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Capture/Webcam#Linux) _(or its alias `v4l2`)_ to list to all capture video devices such as from an USB webcam. You can refer following steps to identify and specify your capture video device's path:

        - [x] **Identify Video Devices:** Linux systems tend to automatically create file device node/path when the device _(e.g. an USB webcam)_ is plugged into the system, and has a name of the kind `'/dev/videoN'`, where `N` is a index associated to the device. To get the list of all available file device node/path on your Linux machine, you can use the `v4l-ctl` command.

            !!! tip "You can use `#!sh sudo apt install v4l-utils` APT command to install `v4l-ctl` tool on Debian-based Linux distros."

            ```sh
            $ v4l2-ctl --list-devices

            USB2.0 PC CAMERA (usb-0000:00:1d.7-1):
                    /dev/video1

            UVC Camera (046d:0819) (usb-0000:00:1d.7-2):
                    /dev/video0
            ```

        - [x] **Specify Video Device's path:** Then, you can specify and initialize your located Video device's path in FFdecoder API as follows:

            ```python
            # initialize and formulate the decoder with "/dev/video0" source for BGR24 output
            decoder = FFdecoder("/dev/video0", source_demuxer="v4l2", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True).formulate()
            ```

        - [x] **[OPTIONAL] Specify Video Device's additional specifications:** You can also specify additional specifications _(such as pixel format(s), video format(s), framerate, and frame dimensions)_ supported by your Video Device as follows:

            !!! tip "You can use `#!sh ffmpeg -f v4l2 -list_formats all -i /dev/video0` terminal command to list available specifications."

            ```python
            # define video device specifications
            ffparams = {"-ffprefixes":["-framerate", "25", "-video_size", "640x480"]}

            # initialize and formulate the decoder with "/dev/video0" source for BGR24 output
            decoder = FFdecoder("/dev/video0", source_demuxer="v4l2", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()
            ```

    === ":material-apple: MacOS"

        MacOS users can use the [AVFoundation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#avfoundation) to list input devices and is the currently recommended framework by Apple for streamgrabbing on Mac OSX-10.7 (Lion) and later as well as on iOS. You can refer following steps to identify and specify your capture video device's name or index on MacOS/OSX machines:

        !!! note "QTKit is also available for streamgrabbing on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and later, but has been marked deprecated since OS X 10.7 (Lion) and may not be available on future releases."


        - [x] **Identify Video Devices:** Then, You can locate your Video device's name and index using `avfoundation` as follows:

            ```sh
            $ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""

            ffmpeg version N-45279-g6b86dd5... --enable-runtime-cpudetect
              libavutil      51. 74.100 / 51. 74.100
              libavcodec     54. 65.100 / 54. 65.100
              libavformat    54. 31.100 / 54. 31.100
              libavdevice    54.  3.100 / 54.  3.100
              libavfilter     3. 19.102 /  3. 19.102
              libswscale      2.  1.101 /  2.  1.101
              libswresample   0. 16.100 /  0. 16.100
            [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7f8e2540ef20] AVFoundation video devices:
            [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7f8e2540ef20] [0] FaceTime HD camera (built-in)
            [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7f8e2540ef20] [1] Capture screen 0
            [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7f8e2540ef20] AVFoundation audio devices:
            [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7f8e2540ef20] [0] Blackmagic Audio
            [AVFoundation input device @ 0x7f8e2540ef20] [1] Built-in Microphone
            ```


        - [x] **Specify Video Device's name or index:** Then, you can specify and initialize your located Video device in FFdecoder API using its either the name or the index shown in the device listing:

            === "Using device's index"

                ```python
                # initialize and formulate the decoder with `1` index source for BGR24 output
                decoder = FFdecoder("1", source_demuxer="avfoundation", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True).formulate()
                ```

            === "Using device's name"

                When specifying device's name, abbreviations using just the beginning of the device name are possible. Thus, to capture from a device named "Integrated iSight-camera" just "Integrated" is sufficient:

                ```python
                # initialize and formulate the decoder with "Integrated iSight-camera" source for BGR24 output
                decoder = FFdecoder("Integrated", source_demuxer="avfoundation", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True).formulate()
                ```

        - [x] **[OPTIONAL] Specify Default Video device:** You can also use the default device which is usually the first device in the listing by using "default" as source:

            ```python
            # initialize and formulate the decoder with "default" source for BGR24 output
            decoder = FFdecoder("default", source_demuxer="avfoundation", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True).formulate()
            ```

    !!! fail "If these steps doesn't work for you then reach us out on [Gitter âž¶][gitter] Community channel"



```python
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder
import cv2

# initialize and formulate the decoder with "/dev/video0" source for BGR24 output
decoder = FFdecoder("/dev/video0", source_demuxer="v4l2", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True).formulate()

# grab the BGR24 frames from decoder
for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

    # check if frame is None
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the frame here}
    
    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
```

## Capturing and Previewing frames from your Desktop 

???+ alert "Example Assumptions"

    Similar to Webcam capturing, FFmpeg provide set of specific Demuxers on different platforms for capturing your desktop _(Screen recording)_. Please note that following recipe explicitly assumes: 

    - You're running Linux Machine with `libxcb` module installed properly on your machine.
    - You machine uses FFmpeg binaries built with `--enable-libxcb` flag to support `x11grab` demuxer. BTW, you can list all supported demuxers using the `#!sh ffmpeg --list-demuxers` terminal command.

    These assumptions **MAY/MAY NOT** suit your current setup. Kindly use suitable parameters based your system platform and hardware settings only.

In this example we will decode live **BGR** video frames from your complete screen as well as a region in FFdecoder API, and preview them using OpenCV Library's `cv2.imshow()` method.

??? tip "Specifying suitable Parameter(s) and Demuxer for Capturing your Desktop on different OS platforms"

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

        Windows OS users can use the [gdigrab](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#gdigrab) to grab video from the Windows screen. You can refer following steps to specify source for capturing different regions of your display:

        !!! fail "For Windows OS users [`dshow`](https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free) is also available for grabbing frames from your desktop. But it is highly unreliable and don't works most of the times."

        - [x] **Capturing entire desktop:** For capturing all your displays as one big contiguous display, you can specify source, suitable parameters and demuxers in FFdecoder API as follows:

            ```python
            # define framerate
            ffparams = {"-framerate": "30"}

            # initialize and formulate the decoder with "desktop" source for BGR24 output
            decoder = FFdecoder("desktop", source_demuxer="gdigrab", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()
            ```

        - [x] **Capturing a region:** If you want to limit capturing to a region, and show the area being grabbed, you can specify source and suitable parameters in FFdecoder API as follows:

            !!! info "`x_offset` and `y_offset` specify the offsets of the grabbed area with respect to the top-left border of the desktop screen. They default to `0`. "

            ```python
            # define suitable parameters
            ffparams = {
                "-framerate": "30", # input framerate
                "-ffprefixes": [
                    "-offset_x", "10", "-offset_y", "20", # grab at position 10,20

            decoder = FFdecoder("desktop", source_demuxer="gdigrab", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()
            ```

    === ":material-linux: Linux"

        Linux OS users can use the [x11grab](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#x11grab) to capture an X11 display. You can refer following steps to specify source for capturing different regions of your display:

        !!! note "For X11 display, the source input has the syntax: `"display_number.screen_number[+x_offset,y_offset]"`."

        - [x] **Capturing entire desktop:** For capturing all your displays as one big contiguous display, you can specify source, suitable parameters and demuxers in FFdecoder API as follows:

            ```python
            # define framerate
            ffparams = {"-framerate": "30"}

            # initialize and formulate the decoder with ":0.0" desktop source for BGR24 output
            decoder = FFdecoder(":0.0", source_demuxer="x11grab", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()
            ```

        - [x] **Capturing a region:** If you want to limit capturing to a region, and show the area being grabbed, you can specify source and suitable parameters in FFdecoder API as follows:

            !!! info "`x_offset` and `y_offset` specify the offsets of the grabbed area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They default to `0`. "

            ```python
            # define suitable parameters
            ffparams = {

=== "Capturing a region" 

    For limit capturing to a region, and show the area being grabbed:

    !!! info "`x_offset` and `y_offset` specify the offsets of the grabbed area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They default to `0`. "

    ```python
    # import the necessary packages
    from deffcode import FFdecoder
    import cv2

    # define suitable parameters
    ffparams = {
        "-framerate": "30", # input framerate
        "-ffprefixes": [
            "-video_size", "1024x768", # frame size
        ],
    }

    # initialize and formulate the decoder with ":0.0" desktop source(starting with the upper-left corner at x=10, y=20) 
    # for BGR24 output
    decoder = FFdecoder(":0.0+10,20", source_demuxer="x11grab", frame_format="bgr24", verbose=True, **ffparams).formulate()

    # grab the BGR24 frames from decoder
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():

        # check if frame is None
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}
        
        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output", frame)

        # check for 'q' key if pressed
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
        if key == ord("q"):
            break

    # close output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # terminate the decoder
    decoder.terminate()
    ```
