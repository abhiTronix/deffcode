!!! alert "Refer Basic Recipes first!"

    If you're just getting started, check out the Beginner's [**Basic Recipes :cake:**](../basic) first before trying these advanced recipes.

??? tip "Any proficiency with OpenCV-Python will be Helpful"
    
    Any proficiency with [**OpenCV-Python**](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) _(Python API for OpenCV)_ surely help you with these recipes. 

??? question "Wanna suggest any improvements or additional recipes?"

    Please feel free to suggest any improvements or additional recipes on our [**Gitter community channel âž¶**][gitter]
