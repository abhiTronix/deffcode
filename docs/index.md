# Introduction

![DeFFcode](assets/images/deffcode.png#only-light){ loading=lazy }
![DeFFcode](assets/images/deffcode-dark.png#only-dark){ loading=lazy }

<center>A cross-platform **:fontawesome-solid-gauge-high: High-performance Video Frames Decoder** that flexibly executes FFmpeg pipeline inside a subprocess pipe for generating real-time, low-overhead, <br>lightning fast video frames with robust error-handling <br>in just a few lines of python code :fontawesome-solid-fire-flame-curved:</center>

<div class="spacer"></div>

**==Highly Adaptive== -** DeFFcode APIs implements a **standalone highly-extensible wrapper around [FFmpeg][ffmpeg]** multimedia framework. These APIs **supports a wide-ranging media streams as input** source such as live USB/Virtual/IP camera feeds, regular multimedia files, screen recordings, image sequences, network protocols _(such as HTTP(s), RTP/RSTP, etc.)_, so on and so forth.

**==Highly Flexible== -** DeFFcode APIs gains an edge over other Wrappers by providing **complete control over the underline pipeline** including **access to almost any FFmpeg specification thinkable** such as specifying framerate, resolution, hardware decoder(s), filtergraph(s), and pixel-format(s) that are readily **supported by all well known Computer Vision libraries**.

**==Highly Convenient== -**  FFmpeg has a steep learning curve especially for users unfamiliar with a command line interface. DeFFcode helps users by providing similar to OpenCV, [**Index based Camera Device Capturing**](recipes/basic/decode-camera-devices) and the **same [OpenCV-Python](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) _(Python API for OpenCV)_ coding syntax for its APIs**, thereby making it even **easier to learn, create, and develop FFmpeg based apps** in Python.

## Key features of DeFFcode

Here are some key features that stand out:

- [x] High-performance, low-overhead video frames decoding with robust error-handling.
- [x] Flexible API with access to almost any FFmpeg specification thinkable.
- [x] Supports a wide-range of media streams/devices/protocols as input source. 
- [x] Curated list of well-documented recipes ranging from [**Basic**](recipes/basic/) to [**Advanced**](recipes/advanced/) skill levels.
- [x] Hands down the easiest [**Index based Camera Device Capturing**](recipes/basic/decode-camera-devices), similar to OpenCV.
- [x] Memory efficient **Live [Simple](recipes/basic/transcode-live-frames-simplegraphs/#transcoding-live-simple-filtergraphs) & [Complex](recipes/advanced/transcode-live-frames-complexgraphs/#transcoding-live-complex-filtergraphs) Filtergraphs**. _(Yes, You read it correctly "Live"!)_
- [x] Lightning fast dedicated **:fontawesome-solid-microchip: GPU-Accelerated Video [Decoding](recipes/advanced/decode-hw-acceleration/#hardware-accelerated-video-decoding) & [Transcoding](recipes/advanced/transcode-hw-acceleration/#hardware-accelerated-video-transcoding)**.
- [x] Enables precise FFmpeg [**Frame Seeking**](recipes/basic/save-keyframe-image/#extracting-key-frames-as-png-image) with pinpoint accuracy.
- [x] Effortless [**Metadata Extraction**](recipes/basic/extract-video-metadata/#extracting-video-metadata) from all streams available in the source.
- [x] Maintains the standard easy to learn [**OpenCV-Python**](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) coding syntax.
- [x] Out-of-the-box support for all prominent Computer Vision libraries.
- [x] Cross-platform, runs on Python 3.7+, and easy to install. 

??? question "Still missing a key feature in DeFFcode?"

      Please review [**DeFFcode's Roadmap**](https://github.com/abhiTronix/deffcode/issues/21#issue-1309685018). If you still can't find the desired feature there, then you can request one simply by **Commenting :speaking_head:** or **Upvoting an existing comment :thumbsup:** [on that issue](https://github.com/abhiTronix/deffcode/issues/21).

### :material-api: API in a nutshell

As a user, you just have to remember only two DeFFcode APIs, namely:

!!! info "See [API Reference](reference/ffdecoder/#ffdecoder-api) for more in-depth information."

<div class="spacer"></div>

#### A. FFdecoder API 

The primary function of [**FFdecoder API**](reference/ffdecoder/#ffdecoder-api) is to **decode 24-bit RGB video frames** from the given source:

```py
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder

# formulate the decoder with suitable source
decoder = FFdecoder("https://abhitronix.github.io/html/Big_Buck_Bunny_1080_10s_1MB.mp4").formulate()

# grab RGB24(default) 3D frames from decoder
for frame in decoder.generateFrame():
    
    # lets print its shape
    print(frame.shape) # (1080, 1920, 3)

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
```

#### B. Sourcer API 

The primary function of [**Sourcer API**](reference/sourcer/#sourcer-api) is to **gather information from all multimedia streams available** in the given source:

```python
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import Sourcer

# initialize and formulate the decoder using suitable source
sourcer = Sourcer("https://abhitronix.github.io/html/Big_Buck_Bunny_1080_10s_1MB.mp4").probe_stream()

# print metadata as `json.dump`
print(sourcer.retrieve_metadata(pretty_json=True))
```

??? abstract "The resultant Terminal Output will look something as following on :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows machine:"
     
      ```json
      {
        "ffmpeg_binary_path": "C:\\Users\\foo\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ffmpeg-static-win64-gpl/bin/ffmpeg.exe",
        "source": "https://abhitronix.github.io/html/Big_Buck_Bunny_1080_10s_1MB.mp4",
        "source_extension": ".mp4",
        "source_video_resolution": [

          1080
        ],
        "source_video_framerate": 60.0,
        "source_video_pixfmt": "yuv420p",
        "source_video_decoder": "h264",
        "source_duration_sec": 10.0,
        "approx_video_nframes": 600,
        "source_video_bitrate": "832k",
        "source_audio_bitrate": "",

        "source_has_video": true,
        "source_has_audio": false,

      }

It is something I am doing with my own free time. But so much more needs to be done, and I need your help to do this. For just the price of a cup of coffee, you can make a difference :slight_smile:
