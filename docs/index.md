<center>DeFFcode - A cross-platform **High-performance Video Frames Decoder** that executes <br>FFmpeg pipeline inside a subprocess pipe for generating real-time, low-overhead, <br>lightning fast video frames with robust error-handling <br>in just a few lines of python code :zap:</center>

<div class="spacer"></div>

DeFFcode APIs implements a standalone highly-extensible wrapper around [**FFmpeg**][ffmpeg] multimedia framework. These APIs **supports a wide-ranging media stream** as input source such as live USB/Virtual/IP camera feeds, regular multimedia files, grabbing devices, image sequences, network URL schemes _(such as HTTP(s), RTP/RSTP, etc.)_, so on and so forth. 

DeFFcode APIs gains an edge over other FFmpeg Wrappers by providing complete control over the underline pipeline including **access to almost any FFmpeg specification thinkable** such as framerate, resolution, hardware decoder(s), complex filter(s), and pixel format(s) that are readily supported by all well known Computer Vision libraries.

Furthermore, DeFFcode **maintains the same standard [OpenCV-Python](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) _(Python API for OpenCV)_ coding syntax** for every API, thereby making it even easier to learn and faster to code these APIs in your python applications without the need to dig into tedious FFmpeg documentation.

## Key features of DeFFcode

Here are some key features that stand out:

- [x] High-performance, low-overhead, lightning fast video frames decoding.
- [x] Supports a wide range of live camera feeds, multimedia files, grabbing devices, etc.
- [x] Effortless metadata extraction from multimedia streams available in the given source.
- [x] Flexible API with access to almost any FFmpeg specification thinkable.
- [x] Curated list of well-documented recipes from [**Basic**](recipes/basic) to [**Advanced**](recipes/advanced) skill levels.
- [x] Out-of-the-box support for all well known Computer Vision libraries.
- [x] Support easy dedicated [**Hardware-Accelerated Decoding**](recipes/advanced/#gpu-enabled-hardware-accelerated-decoding).
- [x] Precise FFmpeg [**Frame Seeking**](recipes/basic/#saving-keyframes-as-image) with pinpoint accuracy.
- [x] Extensive support for real-time [**Complex FFmpeg Filters**](recipes/advanced/#generating-video-with-complex-filter-applied).
- [x] Cross-platform, runs on Python 3.7+, and easy to install. 

<!--
- [x] Lossless Transcoding support with [WriteGear](https://abhitronix.github.io/deffcode/latest/gears/writegear/introduction/). #TODO

### :material-api: API in a nutshell

!!! info "See [API Reference](reference/ffdecoder/#ffdecoder-api) for more in-depth information."

As a user, you just have to remember only two DeFFcode APIs, namely:

#### A. FFdecoder API 

The primary function of [**FFdecoder API**](reference/ffdecoder/#ffdecoder-api) is to **generate 24-bit RGB video frames** from the given source:

```py
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder

# formulate the decoder with suitable source
decoder = FFdecoder("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhiTronix/Imbakup/master/Images/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4").formulate()

# grab RGB24(default) 3D frames from decoder
for frame in decoder.generateFrame():
    
    # lets print its shape
    print(frame.shape) # (720, 1280, 3)

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
```

#### B. Sourcer API 

The primary function of [**Sourcer API**](reference/sourcer/#sourcer-api) is to **gather information from all multimedia streams available** in the given source:

```python
 # import the necessary packages
 from deffcode import Sourcer

 # initialize and formulate the decoder using suitable source
 sourcer = Sourcer("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhiTronix/Imbakup/master/Images/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4").probe_stream()

 # print metadata as `json.dump`
 print(sourcer.retrieve_metadata(pretty_json=True))

```

??? abstract "The resultant Terminal Output will look something as following on :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows machine:"
     
      ```json
      {
        "ffmpeg_binary_path": "C:\\Users\\foo\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ffmpeg-static-win64-gpl/bin/ffmpeg.exe",
        "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhiTronix/Imbakup/master/Images/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4",
        "source_extension": ".mp4",
        "source_video_resolution": [
          1280,

It is something I am doing with my own free time. But so much more needs to be done, and I need your help to do this. For just the price of a cup of coffee, you can make a difference :slight_smile:
