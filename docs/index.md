> DeFFcode is a High-performance Real-time **Video frames Generator** that wraps FFmpeg pipeline inside a subprocess module for generating blazingly fast video frames in python :fire:

The primary purpose of DeFFcode is to provide a one-stop solution for low-memory overhead and faster decoding of a wide range of video streams into 3D NumPy's [`ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html#the-n-dimensional-array-ndarray) frames while providing **complete control over the underlying FFmpeg pipeline** without the need to go deeper into hefty documentation and in just a few lines of python code.

Furthermore, DeFFcode can **extract frames with any custom specification** such as Framerate, Resolution, Hardware decoder, Complex Filter into any pixel format and gives users complete freedom to apply almost any desired FFmpeg supported parameter. 

DeFFcode APIs are designed for **modularity** with clean API separation for building reusable components that are easier to understand and work with. On top of that, DeFFcode enables **effortless and precise FFmpeg Frame Seeking** natively. 


&thinsp;

## Key Features

DeFFcode API is built upon ==[**FFmpeg**][ffmpeg] - a leading multimedia framework==, that gives you the following:

- [x] Extremely exceptional real-time performance :zap: with low-memory footprints.
- [x] Flexible API with access to almost every parameter available within FFmpeg.
- [x] Fast dedicated [Hardware-Accelerated Decoding](examples/advanced/#gpu-enabled-hardware-accelerated-decoding).
- [x] Precise FFmpeg [Frame Seeking](examples/basic/#saving-keyframes-as-image) with pinpoint accuracy.
- [x] Extensive support for real-time [Complex FFmpeg Filters](examples/advanced/#generating-video-with-complex-filter-applied).
- [x] Out-of-the-box support for Computer Vision libraries like OpenCV, Pytorch, etc.
- [x] Support a wide range of media files, devices, image-sequence and network streams.
- [x] Lossless Transcoding support with [WriteGear](https://abhitronix.github.io/deffcode/latest/gears/writegear/introduction/).
- [x] Easier to ingest streams into any pixel format that FFmpeg supports.
- [x] Fewer hard dependencies, and easy to install. 
- [x] Designed modular to be easy to use and learn.
- [x] Cross-platform and runs on Python 3.7+

## Getting Started

!!! tip "In case you're run into any problems, consult our [Help](help/get_help) section."

If this is your first time using DeFFcode, head straight to the [**Installation Notes**](installation/) to install DeFFcode.

The default function of DeFFcode's [**FFdecoder API**](reference/ffdecoder/#ffdecoder-api) is to generate 24-bit RGB (3D [`ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html#the-n-dimensional-array-ndarray)) frames from the given source:

```py
# import the necessary packages
from deffcode import FFdecoder

# formulate the decoder with suitable source(for e.g. foo.mp4)
decoder = FFdecoder("foo.mp4").formulate()

# grab RGB24(default) 3D frames from decoder
for frame in decoder.generateFrame():
    # lets print its shape
    print(frame.shape)

# print metadata as `json.dump`
print(decoder.metadata)

# terminate the decoder
decoder.terminate()
```
