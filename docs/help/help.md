It is (like all open source software) a labour of love and something I am doing with my own free time. If you would like to say thanks, please feel free to make a donation through ko-fi:

<script type='text/javascript' src='https://ko-fi.com/widgets/widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support Me on Ko-fi', '#eba100', 'W7W8WTYO');kofiwidget2.draw();</script> 

Thanks a million! :blush:
