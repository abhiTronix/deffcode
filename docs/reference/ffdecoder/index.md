# FFdecoder API

FFdecoder API is a powerful real-time **Video-frames [Generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators)** built upon [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), that keeps on generating 3D [24-bit RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monochrome_and_RGB_color_formats#24-bit_RGB)(default) NumPy's [`ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html#the-n-dimensional-array-ndarray) frames from its pipeline with low-memory overhead continuously.

FFdecoder supports a **wide range of handle/control media stream** such as any Video Input devices like USB Cameras, Multimedia video file format, Screen Captures, Image Sequences, plus any network stream URL _(such as http(s), rtp, rstp, rtmp, mms, etc.)_.

FFdecoder **wraps FFmpeg pipeline inside a [`subprocess`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html)** that run as completely independent entities and executes the pipeline concurrently with original process, extracting dataframes(in bytes) into NumPy's buffer(as a 1D array) from its `stdout` output. These dataframes are then converted into 3D NumPy's `ndarray` frames that are supported by almost all prominent Computer Vision libraries like OpenCV, Pytorch, dlib ,etc. and can be easily employed to perform various digital processing functions _(like translation, rotation, resizing, cropping, fading, scaling)_ on-the-go.

Furthermore, DeFFcode can **extract frames with any specification** such as Framerate, Resolution, Hardware decoder, Complex Filter into any pixel format FFmpeg supports and also provides extensive support for almost FFmpeg parameter available.
