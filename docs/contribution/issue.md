# Submitting an Issue Guidelines

If you've found a new bug or you've come up with some new feature which can improve the quality of the DeFFcode, then related issues are welcomed! But, Before you do, please read the following guidelines:

??? question "First Issue on GitHub?" 
    
    You can easily learn about it from [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) wiki.

!!! Info 

    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo. If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report issues with less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.

### Search the Docs and Previous Issues

  * Remember to first search GitHub for a [open or closed issue](https://github.com/abhiTronix/deffcode/issues?q=is%3Aissue) that relates to your submission or already been reported.
