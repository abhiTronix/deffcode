==:warning: **DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg binaries to be installed for all of its core functionality.**==


You can following machine-specific instructions for its configuration/installation:

!!! fail "DeFFcode APIs will throw **RuntimeError**, if they failed to detect valid FFmpeg executables on your system."
!!! tip "Enable verbose ([`verbose=True`](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#verbose)) for debugging FFmpeg validation process."

&thinsp;

## :material-linux: Linux FFmpeg Installation

DeFFcode APIs supports **Auto-Detection** and **Manual Configuration** methods on a Linux OS machines:

### A. Auto-Detection 

!!! quote "This is a recommended approach on Linux Machines"

If DeFFcode APIs do not receive any input from the user on [**`custom_ffmpeg`**](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#custom_ffmpeg) parameter, then they try to **auto-detect** the required FFmpeg installed binaries through a validation test that employs `subprocess` python module on the Linux OS systems.

!!! abstract "You can install easily install official FFmpeg according to your Linux Distro by following [this post ➶](https://www.tecmint.com/install-ffmpeg-in-linux/)"


### B. Manual Configuration

* **Download:** You can also manually download the latest Linux Static Binaries _(based on your machine architecture)_ from the link below:
    
    <div style="
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 2px solid lightgray;
            border-radius: 2px 10px;
            margin: 10px;">
    **:material-file-download: Linux Static Binaries:** http://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/
    </div>

* **Assignment:** Then, you can easily assign the custom path to the folder containing FFmpeg executables(`for e.g 'ffmpeg/bin'`)  or path of `ffmpeg` executable itself to the [**`custom_ffmpeg`**](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#custom_ffmpeg) parameter in the DeFFcode APIs.

    !!! warning "If binaries were not found at the manually specified path, DeFFcode APIs will throw **RuntimeError**!"

## :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows FFmpeg Installation

DeFFcode APIs supports **Auto-Installation** and **Manual Configuration** methods on Windows OS machines:

### A. Auto-Installation

!!! quote "This is a recommended approach on Windows Machines"

If DeFFcode APIs do not receive any input from the user on [**`custom_ffmpeg`**](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#custom_ffmpeg) parameter, then they try to **auto-generate** the required FFmpeg Static Binaries from our dedicated [**Github Server**](https://github.com/abhiTronix/FFmpeg-Builds) into the temporary directory(e.g. `C:\Temp`) of your machine on the Windows OS systems.


!!! danger "Active Internet connection is required while downloading required FFmpeg Static Binaries from our dedicated [**Github Server**](https://github.com/abhiTronix/FFmpeg-Builds) onto your :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows machine."

???+ warning "Important Information regarding Auto-Installation"

    * The files downloaded to a temporary directory (e.g. `C:\TEMP`), may get erased if your machine shutdowns/restarts in some cases.

    * You can also provide a custom save path for auto-downloading **FFmpeg Static Binaries** through exclusive [`-ffmpeg_download_path`](../../reference/sourcer/params/#exclusive-parameters) attribute in Sourcer API.

        ??? question "How to use  `-ffmpeg_download_path` attribute in FFdecoder API?"
            
            `-ffmpeg_download_path` is also available in FFdecoder API through the [`-custom_sourcer_params`](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#b-exclusive-parameters) attribute of its `ffparams` dictionary parameter.

    * If binaries were found at the specified path, DeFFcode APIs automatically skips the Auto-Installation step.

    * ==If the required FFmpeg static binary fails to download, extract, or validate during Auto-Installation, then DeFFcode APIs will exit with **RuntimeError**!==


### B. Manual Configuration

* **Download:** You can also manually download the latest Windows Static Binaries _(based on your machine arch(x86/x64))_ from the link below:
    
    <div style="
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 2px solid lightgray;
            border-radius: 2px 10px;
            margin: 10px;">
      **:material-file-download: Windows Static Binaries:** https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows
    </div>

*  **Assignment:** Then, you can easily assign the custom path to the folder containing FFmpeg executables(`for e.g 'C:/foo/Downloads/ffmpeg/bin'`) or path of `ffmpeg.exe` executable itself to the [**`custom_ffmpeg`**](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#custom_ffmpeg) parameter in the DeFFcode APIs.

    !!! warning "If binaries were not found at the manually specified path, DeFFcode APIs will throw **RuntimeError**!"

## :material-apple: MacOS FFmpeg Installation

DeFFcode APIs supports **Auto-Detection** and **Manual Configuration** methods on MacOS OS machines:

### A. Auto-Detection

!!! quote "This is a recommended approach on MacOS Machines"

If DeFFcode APIs do not receive any input from the user on [**`custom_ffmpeg`**](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#custom_ffmpeg) parameter, then they try to **auto-detect** the required FFmpeg installed binaries through a validation test that employs `subprocess` python module on the MacOS systems.

!!! abstract "You can easily install FFmpeg on your MacOS machine by following [this tutorial ➶](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/macOS)"

### B. Manual Configuration

* **Download:** You can also manually download the latest MacOS Static Binaries _(only x64 Binaries)_ from the link below:
    
    <div style="
            padding: 10px; 
            border: 2px solid lightgray;

            margin: 10px;">
    **:material-file-download: MacOS Static Binaries:** https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-mac
    </div>

* **Assignment:** Then, you can easily assign the custom path to the folder containing FFmpeg executables(`for e.g 'ffmpeg/bin'`) or path of `ffmpeg` executable itself to the [**`custom_ffmpeg`**](../../reference/ffdecoder/params/#custom_ffmpeg) parameter in the DeFFcode APIs.
