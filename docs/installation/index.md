# Installation Notes


## Supported Systems

DeFFcode is well-tested and supported on the following systems(but not limited to), with [python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip) installed:

??? alert ":fontawesome-brands-python: Upgrade your `pip`"

    ==It strongly advised to upgrade to latest [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) before installing deffcode to avoid any undesired installation error(s).==

    There are two mechanisms to upgrade `pip`:

    === "`pip`"

        You can use existing `pip` to upgrade itself:

        ??? info "Install `pip` if not present"

            * Download the script, from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py.
            * Open a terminal/command prompt, `cd` to the folder containing the `get-pip.py` file and run:

            === "Linux/MacOS"

                ```sh
                python get-pip.py
                
                ```

            === "Windows"

                ```sh
                py get-pip.py
                
                ```
            More details about this script can be found in [pypa/get-pipâ€™s README](https://github.com/pypa/get-pip).


        === "Linux/MacOS"

            ```sh
            python -m pip install pip --upgrade
            
            ```

        === "Windows"

            ```sh
            py -m pip install pip --upgrade
            
            ```

    === "`ensurepip`"

        Python also comes with an [`ensurepip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-ensurepip) module[^1], which can easily upgrade/install `pip` in any Python environment.

        === "Linux/MacOS"

            ```sh
            python -m ensurepip --upgrade
            
            ```

        === "Windows"

            ```sh
            py -m ensurepip --upgrade
            
            ```

* Any :material-linux: Linux distro released in 2016 or later
* :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows 7 or later
* :material-apple: MacOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later

## Supported Python legacies

:fontawesome-brands-python: [**Python 3.7+**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) are only supported legacies for installing DeFFcode `v0.1.0` and above.

&thinsp;

## Prerequisites

==:warning: **DeFFcode APIs requires FFmpeg binaries to be installed for all of its core functionality.**==

### FFmpeg 

When installing DeFFcode, [**FFmpeg**][ffmpeg] is the only prerequisites you need to configure/install manually. **You could easily do it by referring [**FFmpeg Installation doc**](../installation/ffmpeg_install/)**.

&nbsp;

## Installation

### A. Installation using pip (Recommended)


> _Best option for easily getting stable DeFFcode installed._


**Installation is as simple as:**

??? warning ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows Installation"

    If you are using Windows, some of the commands given below, may not work out-of-the-box.

    A quick solution may be to preface every Python command with `python -m` like this:

    ```sh
    # Install latest stable release
    python -m pip install -U deffcode
    ```

    And, If you don't have the privileges to the directory you're installing package. Then use `--user` flag, that makes pip install packages in your home directory instead:

    ```sh
    # Install latest stable release
    python -m pip install --upgrade --user deffcode
    ```

    Or, If you're using `py` as alias for installed python, then:

    ```sh
    # Install latest stable release
    py -m pip install --upgrade --user deffcode
    ```

```sh
# Install latest stable release
pip install -U deffcode
```

**And you can also download its wheel (`.whl`) package from our repository's [releases](https://github.com/abhiTronix/deffcode/releases) section, thereby can be installed as follows:**

```sh
# Install latest release
pip install deffcode-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

&thinsp;

### B. Installation from Source

>  Best option for trying latest patches(maybe experimental), forking for Pull Requests, or automatically installing all prerequisites(with a few exceptions). 

??? info "Installation using `dev` banch :octicons-git-branch-24:" 

    If you're looking for latest work-in-progress :construction: enhancements or bug-fixes, then you want to checkout our beta [`dev`](https://github.com/abhiTronix/deffcode/tree/dev) branch with the following commands:

    !!! danger "The beta `dev` branch at times can be very unstable or even unusable, User discretion is advised!"

    ```sh
    # clone the repository and get inside
    git clone https://github.com/abhiTronix/deffcode.git && cd deffcode

    # checkout the dev beta branch
    git checkout dev

    # Install it
    pip install -U .
    ```

??? warning ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows Installation"

    If you are using Windows, some of the commands given below, may not work out-of-the-box.

    A quick solution may be to preface every Python command with `python -m` like this:

    ```sh
    # Install latest beta branch
    python -m pip install -U .
    ```

    And, If you don't have the privileges to the directory you're installing package. Then use `--user` flag, that makes pip install packages in your home directory instead:

    ```sh
    # Install latest beta branch
    python -m pip install --upgrade --user .
    ```

    Or, If you're using `py` as alias for installed python, then:

    ```sh
    # Install latest beta branch
    py -m pip install --upgrade --user .
    ```
    

```sh
# clone the repository and get inside
git clone https://github.com/abhiTronix/deffcode.git && cd deffcode

# Install it
pip install -U .
```
